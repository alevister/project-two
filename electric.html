                  At 5 p.m. after a long day’s work, you drive your plug-in
                  electric car to your garage. The car’s battery is fairly full
                  because you drove little today. You plug your car into a
                  charging station, but rather than recharge, you de-charge,
                  pumping excess energy back into the power grid system and
                  helping meet peak energy demand.

                  “ It’s like the Internet,” says Dr. Alex Huang, an electrical
                  engineering professor at North Carolina State University, “but
                  rather than share bits of information—such as Twitter messages
                  and YouTube links—you share electrons.”

                  Sharing energy is just one use of what has been dubbed the
                  Smart Grid, a leaner, more intelligent version of the existing
                  grid. As envisioned, it would use information technology and
                  two-way digital communications to increase grid productivity,
                  diagnose and treat its own problems, and allow consumers to
                  better manage their energy use.

                  Experts claim this technology will save money for both
                  consumers and utilities and will reduce greenhouse gas
                  emissions. The Department of Energy, for example, estimates
                  that increasing the grid’s efficiency by 5 percent would be
                  the equivalent of removing 53 million cars from the road. But
                  some observers note the high cost of equipment to operate a
                  smart grid system could short-circuit the effort.

                  The way the grid stands now, utilities transmit power whenever
                  a user flips a switch. Companies cannot monitor where the
                  energy actually goes or where it is lost along the lines.
                  During peak hours, companies meet demand by using backup
                  “peaker plants,” such as coal-fired power plants, or by buying
                  energy on the stock market. The expense eventually is passed
                  to the consumer, and because the backup system generally
                  relies on dirtier generation methods, it produces more carbon.

                  Homes with smart meters connected to the Smart Grid could help
                  to reduce lost power and save money. For example, a consumer
                  could program his or her air-conditioning system to raise the
                  thermostat in warm weather when demand for air conditioning
                  rises or prices are high.

                  The Smart Grid could also increase access to distributed
                  generation, or on-site renewable energy sources. Huang
                  envisions intelligent homes equipped with small-scale solar
                  generation units that could feed a large battery located at
                  the edge of town.

                  “When demand is high, it’s more economical to use energy
                  stored in a battery rather than turn on a coal-fired power
                  plant,” Huang says. In addition to his work at North Carolina
                  State University, Huang directs the National Science
                  Foundation’s FREEDM Systems Center, which is developing Smart

                  energy.

                  The Department of Energy would like to see a comprehensive
                  national Smart Grid by 2030. In northern Kentucky and parts of
                  Ohio, Duke Energy, the nation’s third largest electric
                  utility, will install 700,000 electric smart meters and
                  450,000 natural gas smart meters during the next five to seven
                  years. The installation will cover 84 percent of Duke Energy’s
                  utility customers in these two states. Developing this system
                  is also costly. Although Duke Energy has allocated $1 billion
                  for hardware installation in Ohio, Indiana and the Carolinas
                  over five years, these funds "won’t build our entire service
                  area,” says Paige Layne, the marketing communications manager
                  for Smart Grid technology at Duke Energy.

                  The future cost to consumers will vary by state. In Ohio, for
                  example, consumer rates increased 50 cents per month this year
                  and will increase by $1.50 in 2010. But since customers will
                  be better able to manage their consumption with Smart Grid
                  technology, the bills will go down, says David Mohler, vice
                  president and chief technology officer for Duke Energy. Last
                  year, 35 participants in a pilot study in Cincinnati reduced
                  their consumption by 10 to 20 percent.

                  The biggest challenge is battery technology, Mohler says.
                  Vehicle batteries require a carrying capacity thousands of
                  times that of a cell phone battery. Engineers have yet to
                  develop one that is both cheap and reliable.

                  Xcel Energy aims to make Boulder, Colo., the first “smart”
                  city by the end of 2009. And Duke Energy has already launched
                  a self-healing grid in Hendersonville, N.C. When a tree fell
                  on Duke Energy lines in June 2009, a nearby network station
                  sensed and isolated the problem area. The station sent an
                  automatic SOS to Duke Energy, quarantined the outage, and
                  rerouted power to affected homes and businesses in a matter of
                  seconds.

                  Without this intelligence, homeowners must report disruptions
                  to the power company. Then a team of linemen rides the
                  lines—through forests and up mountains with flashlights if
                  necessary—to locate the injury. In the Hendersonville case, an
                  additional 1,500 customers would have lost power.

                But developing a Smart Grid system alone will not solve all the
                problems of the existing grid or eliminate the need for additional
                power lines to acquire electricity from renewable resources, Mohler
                says. “Ultimately, we need to do both.”
