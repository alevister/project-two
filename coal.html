                  Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150
                  new coal plants. But a loose network of environmental
                  activists, aided by uncertain economic conditions, has forced
                  plans for more than 100 of the plants to be abandoned. Dozens
                  more are clogged up in the court systems.

                  One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which
                  is already surrounded by four coal-fired power plants.
                  American Municipal Power has proposed building a new Meigs
                  County coal plant, slated to begin construction late this year
                  or in early 2010.

          <h1>What’s the connection between coal and electricity?</h1>
          <p>
            Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired
            power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn the
            turbines of an electrical generator. The U.S. has one of the largest
            coal reserves in the world and burns it at about 600 plants across
            the nation. Generating electricity from coal is common in the South
            and in the heartland, but less often used in regions such as the
            West Coast, where hydroelectricity and natural gas are bigger
            sources of power.

            If coal is so important to electricity generation, why are some
            people concerned about building new coal-fired power plants?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Coal plants emit carbon dioxide, a major ingredient in climate
            change. In recent years, NASA climate scientist James Hansen has
            advocated a moratorium on building new coal plants until technology
            is developed to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the
            atmosphere. Hansen has warned that continuing to release carbon
            dioxide at current rates – even just for the next 10 years – will
            create “a different planet – one without sea ice in the Arctic; with
            worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies associated with storms and a
            continuously rising sea level.” The proposed American Municipal
            Power plant in Meigs County would release an estimated 5.5 million
            tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to CARMA, a nonprofit
            group.

            Why are there so many electricity-generating coal plants near Meigs
            County?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history.
            The county’s newest mine began producing coal last February. An
            experimental site for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology
            to store carbon dioxide underground, is under construction in West
            Virginia near Meigs County's southern border. In addition, a
            coal-to-liquids facility and two other coal-fired power plants have
            been proposed for the region, although at least some of those plans
            appear to be on hold. Meanwhile, Meigs County is one of the poorest
            counties in Ohio, according to 2000 U.S. Census data. Elisa Young, a
            Meigs County resident who has organized opposition to the new plant,
            argues that poverty reduces local opposition to the coal industry.
            “When you have an economy that's entirely wrapped around coal, you
            can't speak out about it,” she says.

            Some Meigs County residents are concerned about the health effects
            of coal plants. Why?
          </h1>
          <p>
            In 2007, the four existing coal plants near Meigs County released
            millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, including arsenic, chromium,
            manganese, mercury, sulfuric acid aerosols and selenium, according
            to the Environmental Protection Agency. Each of these chemicals has
            been linked to human health problems, such as cancer,
            gastrointestinal disorders, impaired motor skills and neurological
            damage. Kent Carson, a spokesperson for American Municipal Power,
            said the proposed plant will use new technology to control
            pollutants. “This will be the cleanest facility of its type in the
            state,” he said.

            Can it be proved that the coal plants are responsible for health
            problems in Meigs County?
          </h1>
          <p>
            It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused health
            problems of a particular individual. “We’re exposed to a soup of
            chemicals,” said Kevin Crist, director of the Center for Air Quality
            at Ohio University. Crist said health problems can be influenced by
            interactions between chemicals, as well as by lifestyle factors. In
            addition, low income – a common characteristic in Meigs County – is
            correlated with health problems. One reason is that poor people are
            more likely to smoke than their wealthier counterparts. More than 30
            percent of adult residents of Southeast Ohio smoke, compared to only
            about 25 percent of residents of other Ohio counties. Crist said
            tall smokestacks on the existing plants probably disperse most
            pollutants away from Meigs County. But he said it is impossible to
            know for sure what residents are being exposed to, because no agency
            monitors the county’s air.

            So what do we know about air quality and health in Meigs County?
          </h1>
          <p>
            An analysis by USA Today estimated that the air quality at Southern
            Elementary School in Meigs County is worse than the air quality at
            97 percent of the nation's schools. USA Today identified two of the
            coal plants near Meigs County as major contributors to pollution at
            the school. In addition, men in Meigs County have the lowest life
            expectancy among men in any Ohio county, according to data compiled
            by Harvard University (women ranked 26th worst of 88 counties).
            Meigs County also has the highest death rate of any Ohio county for
            lung and bronchus cancer, according to the Ohio Department of
            Health.

            Despite the suspected health effects, wouldn’t a new plant create
            much-needed jobs?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Blue-collar labor is especially important in Meigs County, where
            fewer than 5 percent of adult residents hold college degrees and
            more than 25 percent have no high school diploma, according to the
            Ohio Office of Policy, Research and Strategic Planning. In 2007,
            Meigs County's median income was $27,287, about half the national
            average. Many Meigs County residents support the new plant for the
            jobs it may bring to the community. Construction worker Greg Sheets
            has testified in favor of the plant at public hearings. “My family
            will benefit by me going up there and working,” he said. “If I
            reached in your pocket and took $200,000 out of your pocket, would
            you like it?” he said, referring to the income he estimated he could
            earn during the four years it would take to build the plant. But no
            one can guarantee how many jobs will actually go to Meigs County
            residents or how much they will pay. “We all know that not all the
            workers are going to come from Meigs County,” said Sheets, the
            construction worker. “They’ll be from all over the country.”

          <h1>What’s next?</h1>
          <p>
            Before construction can begin on a new coal plant, an energy company
            must receive pollution permits from a state regulatory authority.
            Carson, the American Municipal Power spokesman, said his utility has
            received all the permits it needs and that construction on the plant
            will start in late 2009 or early 2010. Opponents of the plant have
            appealed the plant’s permits. The state of Ohio will allow
            construction to proceed during the appeals process.
